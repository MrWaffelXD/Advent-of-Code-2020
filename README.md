# Advent-of-Code-2020
https://adventofcode.com/

Just my implementation of the Advent of Code 2020 event.

First Im doing the tasks using C#. Maybe I program these tasks in PHP later.

Sorting:
- Separate folder for each day.
- Project names like 2.1 to be able to separate each days task. (Im actually developing every day in a single project, at this point in time) (2.1 = Day 2, Task 1).
